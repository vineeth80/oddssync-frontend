# Backend API base URL (no trailing slash). Used at build time (Vite).
# Local: leave unset or set to http://localhost:8000
# Railway: set when building frontend so production uses production backend, e.g.:
# VITE_API_URL=https://oddssync-backend-production.up.railway.app
# (If unset on Railway, the app falls back by hostname when served from oddssync-frontend-production.up.railway.app.)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
